                                                           *cmp-markdown-link*

cmp-markdown-link is a source for a completion engine nvim-cmp that allows the
user to autocomplete links to local files in markdown files.

The suggestions will depend on the type of link used. cmp-makrdown-link
currently supports three types of links: reference, inline and wiki style
links.

There are several options that can be passed to cmp-markdown-link:

    searched_dirs: ~
        Table of directory paths to search for possible link targets (markdown
        files to link to). The paths are expanded using |expand()|. The
        default is {'%:h'} (i.e. the containing folder of the currently opened
        file).

    searched_depth: ~
        Maximal number of subdirectory levels to search down from each of the
        `searched_dirs`. The default is 5.

    search_pattern: ~
        Lua's match pattern (see Lua's patterns for 'string.match') or
        callback, which should match or return true for valid link targets.
        Default is 'nil' (all found files are valid link targets).
        Examples: >
        ".*%.png"                                               only .png files
        "/home/user/notes/.*"            only files under the 'notes' directory
<

    reference_link_location: ~
        Where should be the link reference placed. Possible locations are:
        - `top` (default) - above the first line of the buffer,
        - `bottom` - below the last line of the buffer.

    wiki_base_url: ~
        Prefix that is removed from the linked file's path, if it matches the
        begining the linked file's relative path. Either you should always use
        the same prefix for all your links (and set the same prefix in your
        markdown viewer) or set prefix as "". Default is "".
        Examples, when 'wiki_base_url' is "notes/": >
        [[a_note.md]]                                link to "notes/a_note.md"
        [[scratch/tmp_note.md]]                  link to "scratch/tmp_note.md"
<
    wiki_end_url: ~
        Suffix that is removed from the linked file's path, if it matches the
        end of linked file's path. Either you should always use the same
        suffix for all your links (and set the same suffix in your markdown
        viewer) or set suffix as "". Default is "".
        Examples, when 'wiki_end_url' is ".md": >
        [[notes/a_note]]                             link to "notes/a_note.md"
        [[texts/a_poem.txt]]                        link to "texts/a_poem.txt"
<

        Examples, when 'wiki_base_url' is "notes/" and 'wiki_end_url' is
        ".md": >
        [[a_note]]                                   link to "notes/a_note.md"
        [[scratch/tmp_note]]                     link to "scratch/tmp_note.md"
        [[a_scribble.txt]]                      link to "notes/a_scribble.txt"
        [[texts/a_poem.txt]]                        link to "texts/a_poem.txt"
