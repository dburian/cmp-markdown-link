cmp-markdown-link is a source for a completion engine nvim-cmp that allows the
user to autocomplete links to local files in markdown files.

There are several options that can be passed to cmp-markdown-link:

        style: ~
                The style of links to be used. Possible styles are:
                - 'reference' (default): >
                        Text surrounding [link label][link_identifier] a link.

                        [link_identifier]: 'path/to/file.md'
<
                   The link identifier is inferred automatically based on
                   the linked filename.

                - 'inline': >
                        Text surrounding [link label](path/to/file.md) a link.
<
                - 'wiki': >
                        Text surrounding [[path/to/file]] a link.
<
                   Warning: This is not a standard markdown syntax. You need
                   an extension to read this kind of link.

        searched_depth: ~
                Number of subdirectory levels down to be searched from the
                containing folder of the currently opened markdown file. The
                default is 5.

        reference_link_location: ~
                Where should be the link reference placed. Possible locations
                are:
                - 'top' (default) - above the first line of the buffer,
                - 'bottom' - below the last line of the buffer.

        wiki_base_url: ~
                Prefix that is removed from the linked file's path, if it
                matches the begining the linked file's relative path. Either
                you should always use the same prefix for all your links (and
                set the same prefix in your markdown viewer) or set prefix as
                "". Default is "".
                Examples, when 'wiki_base_url' is "notes/": >
                [[a_note.md]]                        link to "notes/a_note.md"
                [[scratch/tmp_note.md]]          link to "scratch/tmp_note.md"
<
        wiki_end_url: ~
                Suffix that is removed from the linked file's path, if it
                matches the end of linked file's path. Either you should
                always use the same suffix for all your links (and set the
                same suffix in your markdown viewer) or set suffix as "".
                Default is "".
                Examples, when 'wiki_end_url' is ".md": >
                [[notes/a_note]]                     link to "notes/a_note.md"
                [[texts/a_poem.txt]]                link to "texts/a_poem.txt"
<

                is ".md": >
                [[a_note]]                           link to "notes/a_note.md"
